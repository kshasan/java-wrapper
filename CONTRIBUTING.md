### USE THE 'DEV' BRANCH NOT 'MASTER'

If you want to contribute to the repository, here's a quick guide:
  1. Fork the repository
  2. develop and test your code changes, maven: `mvn test` or gradle: `gradle test`
    * Respect the original code style.
    * Only use spaces for indentation.
    * Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports. If you feel the source code should be reformatted create a separate PR for this change.
    * Check for unnecessary whitespace with git diff --check before committing.
  3. Make the test pass
  4. Commit your changes
  5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request
