 * The IBM Watsonâ„¢ Concept Insights service provides APIs that enable you to work with concepts and identify conceptual associations in the content that you provide as input to the service.
 * Input content is auto-tagged against a concept graph, which is a formal representation of the relationship(s) between concepts.
 * The concept graph used by the Concept Insights service is based on content that has been ingested from the English language Wikipedia.
